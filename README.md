# Project-1 (Python)
# Restaurant menu 

## The project idea is the menu in a fast food restaurant. There are two sections: the first section is related to the manager, and the second section is related to the customer. The events start by asking if the user is a (customer) by pressing the number (1) or if he is a (manager) by pressing the number (2).

## The manager has the following options: review the menu, make sure that the food items are on the menu, and finally add new items to the menu.
## As for the customer, he can review the menu with the price and calories, and then choose the items he wants to add to his order. After that, we display the total price to the customer and the price after tax by using the lambda function. If the customer's bill is more than 400 riyals, he will win water with a glass of ice for free.
