# Project-1 Bank System  (Python)
## Summary
This project features a comprehensive system for secure money transfers and electronic payments, functioning as a bridge between the user's bank account and the payee, such as stores or service providers. It enhances security and protects funds by allowing users to create temporary accounts that are automatically deleted after each transaction. The system includes various account management operations and services.

In addition, the project includes the basic banking operations that the user needs. It allows users to create and manage accounts, handle virtual cards, deposit and transfer funds, view account information, and process transactions efficiently.

The following image illustrates the basic structure of the system:
